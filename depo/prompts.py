EXPLICIT_ENTITY_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = """
You are DEPO Step 2: topic entity extraction and parser-friendly question normalization.

Extract only explicit topic entities in the original question, and produce one lightly normalized question for parser input.

A topic entity is a concrete named thing explicitly mentioned in the question and useful as an anchor for QA decomposition:
person, creative work/title, organization, institution, location, geopolitical place, event, award, treaty, war, product, game, etc.

Do not extract roles, common nouns, answer slots, relation words, wh-words, operators, inferred entities, bare numbers, dates, years, ordinals, quantities, or measurements.

A number or year is allowed only when it is part of a complete official name, such as "Sabotage (1936 Film)", "Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines", or "War of 1812".
Short titles in a typed comparison list may begin with a number; keep the full branch when the surrounding question supplies the type, such as film, album, song, book, game, or series.

Creative works and other titles may contain internal punctuation such as colons, hyphens, apostrophes, parentheses, and subtitles. Treat the full official-looking title as one entity when the punctuation connects title parts; do not split the subtitle into a separate person/place/entity.
Person, place, and organization mentions may also contain disambiguating parentheticals or appositive titles. Preserve the complete surface form when the modifier is part of identifying the entity, such as "Christopher Newton (Criminal)" or "John Ernest, Duke Of Saxe-Eisenach".
Some official titles begin with words that also look like question words, such as When, What, Who, Where, or Which. If that word is part of a capitalized official-looking title span, keep it inside the entity; do not trim the title to the following words.

Do not answer the question.
Do not decompose it into atomic questions.
Do not change the meaning or delete any constraint.
Keep every entity surface form exactly as it appears in the original question.
Only make minimal grammar/parser-friendly edits, such as repairing wh-question word order, adding a missing auxiliary, or smoothing parser-unfriendly phrasing.
The normalized question must still be one single-sentence question.
If the original question is already grammatical and natural, keep it unchanged.

Return JSON only.

Original question:

Candidate spans (Deterministic entity candidates):
{json.dumps(entity_candidates, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}

Task:
Verify which candidate spans are topic entities, and lightly normalize the original question for dependency parsing.
Legacy verified_entities responses are accepted by the parser for compatibility, but you must return the explicit_entities schema below.

Rules:
1. Judge only the supplied candidates.
2. Return explicit_entities as selected entity surfaces copied exactly from the original question.
3. Do not invent, rewrite, merge, split, or offset-correct entity surfaces.
4. Select only concrete named topic entities.
5. Exclude roles, common nouns, answer slots, relation phrases, wh-phrases, operators, inferred entities, and bare dates/numbers/years.
6. Bare years such as "1956" are not entities.
7. Years or numbers inside complete official names may be true, e.g. "Sabotage (1936 Film)" or "War of 1812".
8. If candidate spans overlap, prefer the complete official-looking named mention over its substrings.
9. Internal punctuation in titles, especially colon/subtitle forms, is not a split boundary. A complete title like "Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines" should be true as one Work/Film/Album/Book/etc.; subtitle fragments alone should be false unless independently named in the question.
10. Parenthetical or appositive disambiguators attached to a named entity are part of the entity when they identify the mention, e.g. "Christopher Newton (Criminal)" and "John Ernest, Duke Of Saxe-Eisenach". Do not split the appositive into an independent entity when it is only a title/disambiguator.
11. In typed comparison or choice lists, such as "Which film ..., A or B?", verify each branch that looks like a title as its own entity. A branch may start with a number when the number is part of the title; do not reduce it to the alphabetic substring.
12. A candidate title may start with a capitalized question-like word such as When, What, Who, Where, or Which. If the whole candidate is an official-looking work/title, keep that first word; do not shorten it only because it resembles a wh-word.
13. Do not answer the question or decompose it.
14. Do not remove any restriction or change the semantics.
15. normalized_question must be a single question sentence.
16. Only apply light parser-friendly grammar repair. For example, "Which country the composer of film Thunder On The Hill is from?" becomes "Which country is the composer of film Thunder On The Hill from?"
17. If the original question is already grammatical and natural, return it unchanged and set normalization_changed=false.

Example:
Question: The player who defeated Johnny Majors for the Heisman Trophy in 1956 was born in what year?
True topic entities: "Johnny Majors", "Heisman Trophy"
False candidates: "player", "1956", "what year", "born", "defeated"

ATOMIC_QUESTION_DAG_SYSTEM = r"""
Atomic Question DAG Generator

You are DEPO Step 5. Convert a complex multi-hop question into a complete atomic-question DAG.

Inputs:

1. `original_question`
2. `explicit_entities`
3. `global_best_paths`

Contract:
step4_paths are only structural hints.
DAG nodes do not need path support.

The `original_question` is the semantic authority. Preserve its entities, relations, constraints, comparison conditions, temporal conditions, conjunctions, disjunctions, and final answer intent.

The `global_best_paths` are structural hints only. Use them to infer reasoning order and possible intermediate entities, but ignore any path structure that conflicts with or is irrelevant to the original question.

Atomic question definition:
An atomic question requests exactly one missing fact or performs exactly one final comparison, selection, verification, or aggregation operation.

A factual question is not atomic when it asks for a property of an unresolved latent entity. In that case:

1. identify the latent entity in an earlier node;
2. ask for the required property in a dependent node.

Do not split when the latent entity itself is the requested final answer.

Natural-language and dependency separation:
The `question` field must always be a natural, self-contained question for a human reader.

Never expose internal DAG references in question text.

Forbidden expressions include:

* `q1's answer`
* `q2's answer`
* `the answer to q1`
* any other reference to node IDs or internal variables

Execution dependencies must appear only in `depends_on`.

When a question depends on an earlier node, retain the original entity description or original candidate names in the natural-language question. The corresponding earlier node in `depends_on` indicates that the description will be resolved during execution.

A relational description is considered resolved at execution time when its identifying node is listed in `depends_on`. Do not replace that description with `qN's answer`.

Example:

Original:
When did Lothair II's mother die?

Correct:
{
"atomic_questions": [
{
"id": "q1",
"question": "Who was Lothair II's mother?",
"depends_on": []
},
{
"id": "q2",
"question": "When did Lothair II's mother die?",
"depends_on": ["q1"]
}
]
}

Incorrect:
{
"id": "q2",
"question": "When did q1's answer die?",
"depends_on": ["q1"]
}

Decomposition rules:

1. Generate all and only the questions required to answer the original question.
2. Preserve all explicit entities, modifiers, constraints, and answer intent.
3. Use natural language only. Do not copy parser labels, token indices, path notation, triples, or internal references.
4. Every dependency used by a node must appear in `depends_on`.
5. Every non-final node must contribute to a later node.
6. Do not generate unrelated or unused lookup questions.
7. Resolve latent intermediate entities before asking dependent properties.
8. Do not over-split a relation when its answer is already the final requested answer.
9. Ignore irrelevant or misleading path structure.

Parallel branches:
When the original question compares, ranks, or verifies multiple candidates:

1. generate symmetric factual branches for the values needed by the comparison;
2. generate a final natural-language comparison node;
3. write the final node using the original candidate names or entities;
4. make the final node depend on the nodes that produce the values actually being compared.

Do not replace candidates with dependency answers in the final question.


For comparisons involving properties of latent entities, distinguish:

* identifying nodes;
* value-producing nodes;
* the final candidates to return.

The final comparison node must depend on the value-producing nodes, while its question must use the original candidates.



The final node compares q2 and q4 because they contain the death dates. It returns one of the original film candidates.

Conjunctive constraints:
When multiple branches jointly identify one target:

1. resolve each required constraint;
2. generate a later node that uses all required constraints;
3. include all value-producing dependencies in `depends_on`;
4. express the natural-language question using the original entities and constraints, never internal node IDs.

Final answer-intent:
The final atomic question must preserve the original question's answer type and intent.

Examples:

* “Who” must return a person or named entity.
* “Which film” must return a film, not a date or director.
* “When” must return a date or time.
* “Where” must return a place.
* A yes/no question must return a boolean judgment.
* A comparison must return the candidate requested by the original question.

Output:
Return valid JSON only, using exactly this schema:

{
"atomic_questions": [
{
"id": "q1",
"question": "Natural-language atomic question?",
"depends_on": []
}
]
}

Do not output explanations, comments, markdown, evidence, paths, confidence scores, or additional fields.

Final validation:

1. Does every required original constraint appear?
2. Is every latent entity resolved before a dependent property is requested?
3. Does every non-final node feed into a later node?
4. Does the final node preserve the original answer intent?
5. Do comparison nodes depend on the values actually being compared?
6. Do final comparison questions retain the original candidates?
7. Are all dependencies listed in `depends_on`?
8. Does any question contain `qN`, `qN's answer`, or another internal reference? If so, rewrite it using the original entity description or candidate name.
9. Are there unused leaf nodes? If so, remove or connect them.

* original_question: the full natural-language question

No-path mode has no parser path, no path evidence, and no structural backbone.
You must not construct a pseudo-path, semantic path, relation chain, support span, or any path-like fragment yourself.

Use only the semantics of original_question.
Do not use external knowledge.
Do not answer the question.
Do not invent entities, relations, events, dates, constraints, or comparison criteria.
Preserve all entities, modifiers, constraints, operators, and the final answer intent from original_question.
If the question contains a comparison, equality check, choice, or aggregation, decompose each needed branch and then generate the final comparison, equality, choice, or aggregation action.
If a subquestion depends on a previous answer, express the dependency only in the question text using natural references such as q1's answer, q2's answer, etc.

Action trace rules:

* actions must be a non-empty array.
* id must be q1, q2, q3, ... in order.
* consume must be exactly [] for every action.
* Do not put entities, relations, constraints, qN_answer references, semantic fragments, or any other text in consume.
* produce must be qN_answer for action qN.
* question is the natural-language question to show downstream.
* Do not output depends_on. The program will derive dependencies only from qN's answer references in question text.
